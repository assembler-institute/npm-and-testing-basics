## Description

> This pill is for learning the basics of the **npm** tool to handle the dependencies and how to test your code with **Jest**.
>
> **npm** is a tool that manages the **dependencies** of our Javascript project, both in client and in backend (NodeJs).
>
> **Jest** is a JavaScript test runner, that is, a JavaScript library for creating, running, and structuring tests to ensure your code is doing what you expected it to do.
>
> This pill already includes the solution for the tests.

## Technologies used

\* NPM Tool

\* Javascript

\* MomentJS Library

\* Lodash Library

\* Jest Library

## Installation

First of all, once you have created and located to the folder where you want to place the local repository, you will have to clone the remote by running `git clone https://github.com/assembler-school/npm-and-testing-basics.git`.

Once the repository has been cloned, you will have to use NPM to install the project dependencies by running `npm install`. This will install **Jest**, **Lodash** and **Moment** libraries.

## Usage

In order to run the test, you will have to run `npm test` to check that the tests are correctly fulfilled. This instruction is the same as running `npx jest --coverage`.

When running the test, a report including the results will be generated inside the **coverage** folder. Every time the test is runned, the report is updated.
