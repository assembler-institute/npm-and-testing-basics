> In this pill I have learned how to install and use **npm**, how to initialize **npm** on a repository and how to read and work with its _package.json_ file.
>
> I have learned how to install new libraries such as **Lodash**, **Jest** and **Moment** either installing them as production dependencies either as development dependencies.
>
> Using _.gitignore_ to avoid charge several files on the remote repository, **npm install** to install all the dependencies included into de _package.json_, **npm install --save-dev** to install as development dependencies, **npm update** to get the last version, **npm uninstall** to uninstall certain dependecy and **npm run test** to run the test once I've installed the _Jest_ library. Also, I've learned the basics about how to code tests.
