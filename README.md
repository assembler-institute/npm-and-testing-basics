# NPM and testing basics

Project based on installing, updating and uninstalling some repositories with NPM to understand better this package manager. Repositories we worked with: **MomentJS**, **Lodash**, **jQuery**, **Jest**.

A second part of this project deepens into the testing framework **Jest**, creating six tests for six functions where we also learned a bit more about **MomentJS** and **Lodash**.

## Prerequisites

- **NodeJS** with **NPM**: https://nodejs.org/en/

## Installing

To set de dev environment just run this on console:

_npm install_

## Tests

The tests run on the functions of the **src** folder.
The _date.js_ functions are tested to check if they show the actual day, month and year using **MomentJS** methods.
The _util.js_ functions are tested to check some of the **Lodash** repository functions: creation of arrays, transform text to camelCase format and getting the index of a specific item from an Array.

To run the test you just need to add this to the console:
_npm run test_
